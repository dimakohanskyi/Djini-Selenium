<h3>------------------------Description---------------------</h3>

<p>
I created a program that will help to follow up the
current information on the labor market for QA Engineers and Python Developers.
This script take all data from different resources and add it to database.
Every Mondays this code sends an email with current salary information,
motivation card and all my contacts. I created another way of get 
information, It's Telegram Bot. Which also take all current information from database
and when a certain command is called, it sends the result into the chat.
